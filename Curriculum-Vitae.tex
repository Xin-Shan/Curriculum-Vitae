    \item{\textbf{Master Thesis (2016-2018): }\textit{'Research on Laser Information and Energy Transmission Between Sea Observatory Network and AUV.'}

    \vspace{3pt}

    \small{This thesis aimed to integrate the communication and positioning functions into one portable device, which can guide underwater vehicles to the nodes of sea observatory network and allow the information and energy exchanging between them. I wrote an algorithm (FPGA Verilog), designed the hardware, and did the thermal and optical design for this system. A preliminary experiment of underwater laser charging was also included.}}

    \vspace{6pt}

    \item{\textbf{National High-Tech R\&D Program of China (No.2014AA09A513-1): }\textit{'Monitoring and Networking Technology of Autonomous Portable Profiler'}

    \vspace{3pt}

    \small{As a team member, my attribution was mainly on designing of main control board hardware (PCB), data logging program (STM32 Platform / C++Programing Language) and some auxiliary devices (deploy and recovery devices, etc.). I also worked with my team to assemble and debug the profiler. I attended the sea trial in July 2017 cooperated with 715 Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation.}}
